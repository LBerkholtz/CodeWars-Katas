/*Scenario
With Cereal crops like wheat or rice, before we can eat the grain kernel, we need to remove that inedible hull, 
or to separate the wheat from the chaff.

Task
Given a sequence of n integers , separate the negative numbers (chaff) from positive ones (wheat).  

Notes
Sequence size is at least 3
Return a new sequence, such that negative numbers (chaff) come first, then positive ones (wheat).
In Java , you're not allowed to modify the input Array/list/Vector
Have no fear , it is guaranteed that there will be no zeroes . !alt
Repetition of numbers in the input sequence could occur , so duplications are included when separating.
If a misplaced positive number is found in the front part of the sequence, replace it with the last misplaced 
negative number (the one found near the end of the input). The second misplaced positive number should be swapped 
with the second last misplaced negative number. Negative numbers found at the head (begining) of the sequence , 
should be kept in place .
